          <p>
            Technology and science are evolving, we are moving from the era
            where we understand that genetics and the environment alone are
            crucial for development to a better understanding that exposing your
            child to learning experiences tailored to brain development, is key
            to helping your child reach his or her full potential! Brain studies
            show that the highest sensitivity to learning new skills occurs
            during the first four years. Early exposure to specific activities
            will postively affect the architecture of your childâ€™s brain and
            boost their academic outcomes.
